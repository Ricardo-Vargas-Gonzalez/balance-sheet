# NOTES

The CSS you are about to write is a common set of properties used to ensure elements are completely hidden visually.

The span[class~="sr-only"] selector will select any span element whose class includes sr-only. Create that selector, and give it a border property set to 0.

The :first-of-type pseudo-selector is used to target the first element that matches the selector.
